Project Overview
This project focused on transforming raw transactional retail data into an executive-ready dashboard that enables quick business decisions.
The data model was designed using a proper Star Schema, including:
•	FactSales (transaction-level data)
•	Date, Product, Customer, and Region dimensions
Advanced DAX measures were used to calculate key KPIs such as:
•	Total Sales & Profit
•	Profit Margin %
•	Year-over-Year Growth
•	Running Totals
•	Top/Bottom Product Analysis
•	Customer Contribution (Pareto 80/20 Analysis)
